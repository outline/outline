In an Outline document, paste a _public_ share link to an [Abstract](https://abstract.com) artboard and it will be immediately converted into an interactive, live embed.

Embedding an artboard from Abstract in your knowledge base rather than a static image will enable it to stay upto date with your work in Abstract. Find out more about [Abstract public sharing](https://www.abstract.com/blog/public-sharing/).
