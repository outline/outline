Outline is a place to build your team knowledge base, you could think of it like your team’s shared library – a place for important documentation, notes, and ideas to live and be discovered. Some things you might want to keep in Outline:

- Documentation
- Sales playbooks
- Support scripts
- Onboarding
- HR documents
- Meeting notes
- …and more

## Structure

Outline allows you to organize documents in "collections", for example these could represent topics like Sales, Product, or HR. Within collections documents can be interlinked and deeply nested to easily build relationships within your knowledge base.

## Search

Outline is built from the ground up to be really fast, and that includes [search](/search). You can start searching from anywhere with the `CMD+K` shortcut – then filter by time, author, and more to find the information you need. Or you can search from within Slack with the `/outline` slash command.
