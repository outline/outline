## Details
- **Issue ID**: #9709

## Description
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### This is not related to configuring Outline

- [x] The issue is not related to self-hosting config

### Current Behavior

When retrieving a page via API, newlines in tables are represented as `<br>`, due to https://github.com/outline/outline/pull/9405
When writing a page via API, this is not parsed as a newline and instead inserted as literal. All empty cells afterward contain `<br>` and all newlines in cells are replaced by `<br>` in a single line.

### Expected Behavior

- Writing back the same content does not change the page
- Tables should not contain `<br>` as text.

### Steps To Reproduce

- Get the content of a page with a table via API
- Write this same content back
- If the site was previously edited manually, restart the container and clear all cookies to circumvent https://github.com/outline/outline/issues/6459
- Observe <br> as a literal in every field 

### Environment

```markdown
- Outline: v0.85.1 Enterprise
- Browser: Firefox ESR
```

### Anything else?

This seems to have been introduced with 0.85.0, it previously didn't happen.
