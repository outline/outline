## Description
If you want to publish a draft in a collection in which the user has read rights within a subordinate document in which the user has write rights, this is not possible. When publishing, the system only looks at the top level to see whether the necessary write permissions have been granted on this level.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make a collection with read permissions
2. Make a document with write permissions
3. Create a new draft
4. Try to publish the draft unter de document with write permissions
