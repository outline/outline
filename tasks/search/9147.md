### Current Behavior

Hi,

Firstly, thanks for maintaining outline.

We are experiencing the following issue which has popped up before.

We have docs in a few collections that start with the following pattern and we have automation that looks for this pattern at the start

```sh
"\n| **Document owner** |"
```


When we upgraded from `v0.78.0` -> `v0.79.1`, the upgrade automatically removed the leading `\n` character and our automation failed. So we updated our automation to look for this pattern:

```sh
"| **Document owner** |")
```

At a later stage, when we upgraded from `v0.80.2` to `v0.81.0`, the upgrade automatically added the `\n` character back and we changed our automation again.

Upgrading from `v0.82.0`  -> `v0.83.0` has removed the leading `\n` again.

Just trying to understanding if this is expected behaviour and the reason behind upgrades removing/adding leading `\n` characters so that we can update our automation accordingly.

Thanks.
