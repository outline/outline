### Expected Behavior

Do not create a new checklist item
Delete the next character of the following line instead

### Steps To Reproduce

1. create a checklist
2. move the cursor to the end of the line of the last checklist item
3. press DEL key on keyboard

if you cannot reproduce, maybe press the DEL key twice/ multiple times.
