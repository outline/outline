## Description
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### This is not related to configuring Outline

- [x] The issue is not related to self-hosting config

### Current Behavior

When converting a numbered list that contains nested items into a bulleted list, only the top-level items change. The nested items remain numbered and must be converted individually.

### Expected Behavior

Selecting the entire list, including nested items, and switching to bullets should convert every item to a bullet "style" in one step.

### Steps To Reproduce
