## Description
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### This is not related to configuring Outline

- [x] The issue is not related to self-hosting config

### Current Behavior

When writing LaTeX formulas, I wanted to align the equations and searched online for solutions. Some answers suggested using the aligned environment and provided example code:

\begin{ 
   equation}
\begin{ 
   aligned}
......
\end{ 
   aligned}
\end{ 
   equation}

After copying this code into Outliners' LaTeX module, it didn't work. Even worse, the entire document now fails to open - though I can still see it in the version history. I tried using the restore function without success. Screenshots of the document's current state and version history are attached below.

i am using outline self-hosted  docker version 0.83.0
