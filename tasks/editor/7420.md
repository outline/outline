## Description
Hello,

When an http link is attributed to a image (using ctrl +k shortcut for exemple), a left clic on the picture from the "private" wiki page redirect to the appropriate address.

However, if the page is accessed via a public link (generated using "share / web" menu), the http link is no longer present, and only the image zoom option appears.
