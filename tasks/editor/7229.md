## Description
An editor at the collection level is not the same as an editor at the document level

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Document scenario:
1. Add someone as an editor to a document
2. Login as that user
3. Try to edit the document -> you **can**
4. Try to make a child document -> you **cannot**
5. Try to delete the document -> you **can**
6. Try to share the document -> you **cannot**

Collection scenario:
1. Add someone as an editor to a collection
2. Login as that user
3. Try to edit a document in that collection -> you **can**
4. Try to make a child document of a document in that collection -> you **can**
5. Try to delete a document in that collection -> you **can**
6. Try to share a document in that collection -> you **can**

**Expected behavior**
Since collections and parent documents are similar in that they can have docs nested below them, I'd expect a permission role on one to be the same as a permission role on the other given they have the same name. Ideally, there's be permission granularity so that:

- Editor: Can make changes to a document they already have permissions on, cannot create or delete
- Content Manager: Can make changes, create, and delete documents
- Admin: Can manage permissions and do all the things a content manager can
