## Description
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### This is not related to configuring Outline

- [x] The issue is not related to self-hosting config

### Current Behavior

There have been some discussions about this but nothing has come of it. Hence, I'm issuing a bug report.

In Outline v0.85.1 (self-hosted), drag-and-drop reordering of checklist items works perfectly on desktop browsers, but fails on Android mobile browsers, including:

Google Chrome (latest stable)

Samsung Internet

Opera


Checklist items cannot be reordered via touch interactions. Tapping and holding does not trigger a drag event, and the items remain static.

This issue may be related to react-beautiful-dnd, which is known to have limited or inconsistent support for mobile touch events ‚Äî especially on Android. If Outline is using that or a similar drag-and-drop library, this could be the root cause.

‚úÖ Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an Outline doc in Chrome on Android

2. Create a checklist with multiple items

3. Attempt to long-press and drag an item to reorder it

4. Nothing happens ‚Äî no drag indicator or movement

üí° Expected Behavior:

Checklist items should be draggable on mobile with touch-and-hold, just like they are with mouse on desktop.

üì± Environment:

Outline version: 0.85.1 (Docker, self-hosted)

Android OS version: 15 (OneUI 7)

Browsers tested:

Chrome

Samsung Internet

Opera

Android System WebView: v138.0.7204.68


üìù Notes:

Not all users are reporting this issue, which may point to subtle differences in touch event propagation or rendering layers across devices or browser versions.

If this is tied to react-beautiful-dnd, switching to a touch-friendly alternative like dnd-kit or implementing custom mobile handling could resolve it.

Would appreciate any guidance on this ‚Äî or confirmation if it‚Äôs a known limitation.
