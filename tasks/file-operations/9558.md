## Description
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### This is not related to configuring Outline

- [x] The issue is not related to self-hosting config

### Current Behavior

When importing a json file that has a raw text node outside a paragraph, it seems large parts of the document are ignored.

```
{
                "type": "doc",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "paragraph",
                        "content": [
                            {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "Some paragraph with some text."
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "Wow! Such text"
                    }
                ]
            }
```

This will get imported to an empty page with no errors of any kind.

### Expected Behavior

An error message saying that it doesn't match the schema or something.

### Steps To Reproduce

Import the attached file 
[export.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21100036/export.zip)

### Environment

```markdown
- Outline: 0.84.0
- Browser: Firefox
```

### Anything else?

I know the json import is somewhat internal. But it's very nice to write importers for it, as the current markdown parser is kinda limited in what it can import (no embeds, notices inside table cells, or highlighted text, for example).

Ensuring that a successful import actually means that outline understood the whole document is quite useful in my opinion.
